# Funny-talks

User [@hellerve](https://github.com/hellerve) has a great [repository](https://github.com/hellerve/programming-talks) which has links to a lot of fantastic talks. This repo is in a similar vein as well with the only stipulation being that the talks should be humorous and entertaining.

We are going to arrange talks by programming langauge and by topics. As such there is no restriction on how the talks are given. They don't even need to be talks, even articles and podcasts are fine(Yes, I know the repo is named Funny-talks.)

I welcome all contributions to the repo. Open a pull request to this repo or open a issue with link to the work and I'll look through it.

**Disclaimer:** I did not give any of the talks on the list and am responsible neither for their content nor for their presentation. If you are an author of one of the talks in this list and don't want them here drop me a line and I'll remove it.
